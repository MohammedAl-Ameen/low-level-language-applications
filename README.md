# low-level-language-applications

----- 16F877A Pic Microcontroller -----

I used MAPLAX for the assembly language a along with Protues for the hardware components.

C-compiler were used to write C command to the Microcontroller.


----- Embedded Applications -----
In general I used Protues for the hardware components along with a C compiler to controll the chips,
for the Arduino I used the official compiler for the chip, as for the PLC I used Mitsubishi FX Trainer.

Chips that been used in the Embedded repository:
1. 16F877A
2. Arduino UNO
3. PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)


----- Quartus for low level designs -----
I used the program Quartus ii to compile the VHDL code. to design a the performance for the computer components.
